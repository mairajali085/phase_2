# AI-Assisted Spec-Driven Engineer Skill

## Description
This skill provides comprehensive assistance with Spec-Driven Development methodology, including writing specifications before coding, AI-assisted development, feature breakdown, API contract definition, and test-first mindset implementation.

## Capabilities
- Write comprehensive feature specifications before implementation
- Leverage AI tools for assisted development workflows
- Break down complex features into manageable tasks
- Define clear API contracts and interfaces
- Implement test-first development approaches
- Create detailed acceptance criteria
- Design system architecture based on specifications
- Generate implementation plans from specs
- Create documentation following specification guidelines
- Implement code that strictly follows defined specifications
- Validate implementation against original specs
- Refactor specifications as requirements evolve

## Best Practices
- Write clear, testable specifications before writing code
- Use AI tools to enhance development productivity
- Break features into small, achievable tasks
- Define API contracts with comprehensive documentation
- Follow test-driven development principles
- Maintain alignment between specs and implementation
- Use version control for specification management
- Create detailed acceptance criteria for features
- Implement continuous validation against specs
- Document decisions and changes to specifications
- Ensure specifications are understandable by all stakeholders
- Apply iterative refinement to specifications

## Common Commands
- Create feature specifications with acceptance criteria
- Generate API contract documentation
- Break down complex features into tasks
- Implement test-first development workflows
- Create implementation plans from specifications
- Generate code based on defined specifications
- Validate implementation against original specs
- Update specifications based on new requirements
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Generate test cases from feature specs
- Document API endpoints and contracts

## Prompt
When working with Spec-Driven Development, focus on implementing features following the specification-first methodology. Ensure comprehensive feature specifications are written before any implementation begins, leverage AI-assisted development tools effectively, break complex features into manageable tasks with clear acceptance criteria, define clear API contracts with comprehensive documentation, and maintain a test-first mindset throughout development. Prioritize specification adherence, maintainability, and code quality while ensuring all implementation aligns with the original specifications and follows best practices for AI-assisted development workflows.
