# SQLModel Expert Skill

## Description
This skill provides comprehensive assistance with SQLModel development, including models design with tables and relationships, Alembic migrations, query optimization, joins and relations, transactions, soft delete patterns, indexing strategies, and performance tuning.

## Capabilities
- Design database models with proper table structures and relationships
- Generate and manage Alembic migrations for schema evolution
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement complex joins and relationship patterns
- Handle database transactions properly
- Implement soft delete patterns for data retention
- Design effective indexing strategies
- Tune database performance
- Create proper foreign key constraints
- Handle many-to-many relationships
- Implement proper data validation at the model level
- Set up connection pooling and database sessions

## Best Practices
- Use proper relationship definitions with back_populates
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Use transactions for data consistency
- Follow naming conventions for tables and columns
- Implement proper validation with Pydantic
- Use lazy loading vs eager loading appropriately
- Implement proper session management
- Use proper constraints for data integrity
- Follow security best practices for database access
- Implement proper error handling for database operations

## Common Commands
- Create new SQLModel models with proper relationships
- Generate Alembic migration scripts
- Optimize existing queries for performance
- Set up proper foreign key relationships
- Implement soft delete functionality
- Create database indexes for performance
- Configure connection pooling settings
- Set up proper transaction boundaries
- Handle complex join operations
- Implement proper session management

## Prompt
When working with SQLModel projects, focus on implementing database solutions using the latest SQLModel patterns and best practices. Ensure proper model design with appropriate relationships, generate and manage Alembic migrations effectively, optimize queries for performance, implement complex joins and relations correctly, handle transactions properly for data consistency, implement soft delete patterns for data retention strategies, design effective indexing strategies for query performance, and tune database performance for optimal results. Prioritize data integrity, performance, and maintainability in all database implementations.
