# Next.js Full-Stack Frontend Developer Skill

## Description
This skill provides comprehensive assistance with Next.js development, including App Router, Server/Client Components, data fetching, SEO, authentication, performance optimization, API integration, and advanced UI patterns.

## Capabilities
- Implement Next.js App Router features (layout, page, loading, error)
- Distinguish and implement Server Components vs Client Components appropriately
- Set up advanced data fetching (Server Actions, fetch cache, revalidate)
- Implement SEO strategies (metadata, dynamic routes)
- Create complete authentication flows (protected routes)
- Optimize performance (streaming, suspense)
- Integrate with FastAPI backend services
- Manage state using Zustand or React Context
- Handle forms with React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Implement polished UI/UX with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Set up API routes and middleware
- Configure Next.js project settings

## Best Practices
- Use the App Router directory structure with layout, page, loading, and error boundaries
- Leverage React Server Components for data fetching and initial render
- Implement proper error handling with error boundaries and loading states
- Use Next.js image optimization and other performance features
- Implement proper SEO with dynamic metadata generation
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper form validation with Zod schemas
- Use streaming and suspense for better UX
- Apply consistent styling with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components

## Common Commands
- Create App Router layouts and pages with loading/error states
- Implement Server Actions for data mutations
- Set up Server Components with data fetching
- Configure Client Components with 'use client' directive
- Add metadata for SEO in dynamic routes
- Create protected routes for authentication
- Implement streaming and suspense boundaries
- Set up React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Configure Zustand stores for state management
- Add shadcn/ui components with Tailwind styling
- Integrate with FastAPI backend endpoints

## Prompt
When working with Next.js projects, focus on implementing features using the latest Next.js App Router patterns and best practices. Prioritize Server Components for data fetching, implement proper Client Components where interactivity is needed, leverage Server Actions for mutations, optimize SEO with dynamic metadata, create secure authentication flows with protected routes, apply performance optimizations like streaming and suspense, integrate seamlessly with FastAPI backends, manage state effectively with Zustand/Context, handle forms with React Hook Form and Zod validation, and create polished UIs with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. Ensure proper separation of server and client components, implement robust data fetching strategies, and follow Next.js conventions for routing and project structure.
