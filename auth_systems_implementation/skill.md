# Auth Systems Implementation Skill

## Description
This skill provides comprehensive assistance with authentication system implementation, including JWT and session-based authentication, OAuth integration (Google, GitHub), role-based access control (RBAC), middleware protection, and secure cookies with CSRF protection.

## Capabilities
- Implement JWT-based authentication with proper token management
- Set up session-based authentication systems
- Integrate OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Design and implement role-based access control (RBAC) systems
- Create authentication and authorization middleware
- Implement secure cookie handling and CSRF protection
- Manage token refresh and expiration strategies
- Handle user registration and login flows
- Implement password hashing and verification
- Set up multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Configure secure session management
- Implement logout and token invalidation

## Best Practices
- Use secure JWT token generation with proper signing algorithms
- Implement proper token refresh strategies
- Follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, argon2, etc.)
- Implement proper session management with secure cookies
- Apply CSRF protection with proper validation
- Use HTTPS for all authentication flows
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Follow security best practices for token storage
- Use proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Implement secure password reset flows
- Apply principle of least privilege in RBAC

## Common Commands
- Set up JWT authentication with token generation and validation
- Configure OAuth integration with popular providers
- Implement RBAC with role and permission management
- Create authentication middleware for route protection
- Set up secure cookie configuration with CSRF protection
- Implement user registration and login systems
- Configure password hashing and verification
- Set up token refresh mechanisms
- Implement logout and session invalidation
- Create authorization checks for protected resources

## Prompt
When working with authentication systems, focus on implementing secure and robust solutions using industry-standard practices. Ensure proper JWT token management with secure signing and refresh strategies, implement OAuth integration with major providers like Google and GitHub, design comprehensive role-based access control systems, create effective middleware for route protection, and implement secure cookie handling with proper CSRF protection. Prioritize security, user experience, and scalability in all authentication implementations while following security best practices and industry standards.
