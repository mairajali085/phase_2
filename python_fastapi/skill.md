# FastAPI Backend Engineer Skill

## Description
This skill provides comprehensive assistance with FastAPI development, including REST API design, request/response validation, async programming, CRUD operations, dependency injection, background tasks, pagination, rate limiting, API versioning, and OpenAPI customization.

## Capabilities
- Design RESTful APIs following best practices
- Implement request/response validation with Pydantic models
- Write asynchronous code using async/await patterns
- Create full CRUD APIs with proper HTTP status codes
- Implement dependency injection for shared functionality
- Set up background tasks for async processing
- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting features
- Configure rate limiting for API endpoints
- Set up API versioning strategies
- Customize OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Create database models and relationships
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Best Practices
- Use Pydantic models for all request/response validation
- Implement proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use dependency injection for reusable components
- Implement async/await for I/O bound operations
- Follow security best practices
- Use proper error handling with HTTPException
- Implement comprehensive API documentation
- Follow type hinting best practices

## Common Commands
- Create new API endpoints with proper validation
- Define Pydantic models for request/response schemas
- Set up dependency injection functions
- Implement CRUD operations for resources
- Add background task handlers
- Configure pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Set up rate limiting middleware
- Implement API versioning
- Customize OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Create database models with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy

## Prompt
When working with FastAPI projects, focus on implementing features using the latest FastAPI patterns and best practices. Ensure proper type hinting with Pydantic models for request/response validation, implement robust async programming with async/await, design clean REST APIs with proper HTTP status codes, leverage dependency injection for shared functionality, implement background tasks for async processing, add pagination/filtering/sorting for data operations, configure rate limiting for API protection, implement API versioning strategies, and customize OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for better developer experience. Prioritize security, performance, and maintainability in all implementations.
